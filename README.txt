MW-Portfolio Outcome 2 Optimisation

SEO optimisation techniques that I have used to improve search result placement for my website:

* I have used heading tags in descending order on the body of pages with multiple headings to show the order of importance in the headings.
* I have added meta tags for the author and keywords to the header to increase its chances of showing up at the top of a search result by adding information
that people will be searching for, such as the language or subject.
* I also added a descripton meta tag, which is a brief but detailed description of the page also using keywords that is designed to take the readers attention and
entice them to click on the website.
