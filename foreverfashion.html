  <h1>Forever Fashion</h1>
  <p>I worked on this website as part of a group project at college along with Laura Balestrieri and Amanda Gonzalez-Santana.</p>
  <p>I helped contribute the logo which I made in photoshop and converted to a vector and the blog and contact pages based on wireframes our designer, Amanda, created. The rest of the pages were created by Laura.</p>
  <p>This was my first time learning how to use bootstrap and how to modify it for things such as the entries on the blog page.</p>
